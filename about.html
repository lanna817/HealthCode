  <h2>Why we do this</h2>

  <P>We want you to be able to make an informed decision about where you <span class="codeRed">EAT</span>. That includes
    the latest info from
    the NYC Health Department. Here you can find restaurants who scored a <span class="codeRed">C</span> when it came to
    food safety.
    Be informed about the places you <span class="codeRed">EAT</span> by entering your zipcode and reading the
    violations
    from food temperature to rodents that might make you think twice before getting that slice!</P>
