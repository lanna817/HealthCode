1. Problem-solving approach
Lot's of trial and error. Trying so many different approaches
2. Struggles you encountered and how you solved them
Flip card not flipping all the div's. After trying various methods I just reworked the CSS until it fit. Obtaining specific results from the API. I used the dot map method.

Fixed transition problem. Could not get borough to display on page.
